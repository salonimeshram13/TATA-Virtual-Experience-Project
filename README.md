This job simulation is with one of TATA groups companies, Tata Insights and Quants or Tata iQ. Here we will gain insight into how their passionate multi-disciplinary experts solve some of the most complex business problems using data visualisation solutions, such as Tableau and Power BI and create amazing stories which are hidden under the mountains of data generated. 
## Background information of the task
An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.

The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on whatâ€™s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

The task included following four steps-
- Framing the Business Scenario
- Choosing the Right Visuals
